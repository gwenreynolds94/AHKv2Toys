Server applications send this event for their accessible objects. This event signals a single selection: either a child is selected in a container that previously did not contain any selected children, or the selection has changed from one child to another.

This event is generated in response to a change in the top-level object within the object hierarchy; it is not generated for any children that the object might have. For example, if the user resizes a window, the system sends this notification for the window, but not for the menu bar, title bar, scroll bar, or other objects that have also changed. The system does not send this event for every non-floating child window when the parent moves. However, if an application explicitly resizes child windows as a result of resizing the parent window, the system sends multiple events for the resized children. If an object's State property is set to STATE_SYSTEM_FLOATING, the server sends EVENT_OBJECT_LOCATIONCHANGE whenever the object changes location. If an object does not have this state, servers only trigger this event when the object moves in relation to its parent.
