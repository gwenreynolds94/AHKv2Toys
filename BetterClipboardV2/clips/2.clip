SCI_SETMARGINTYPEN(int margin, int marginType)
SCI_GETMARGINTYPEN(int margin) ? int
These two routines set and get the type of a margin. The margin argument should be 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. You can use the predefined constants SC_MARGIN_SYMBOL (0) and SC_MARGIN_NUMBER (1) to set a margin as either a line number or a symbol margin. A margin with application defined text may use SC_MARGIN_TEXT (4) or SC_MARGIN_RTEXT (5) to right justify the text. By convention, margin 0 is used for line numbers and the next two are used for symbols. You can also use the constants SC_MARGIN_BACK (2)
